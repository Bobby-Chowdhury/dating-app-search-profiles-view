# dating-app-search-profiles-view

A search algorithm written in Django-flavored python using set operation "exclude" between user provided filter criterion and member privacy settings to display search results of member profiles. 

This is only a very small part of the larger application, so cannot and should not be used by anyone other than maybe to get a conceptual overview. I maintain the full code base for the app in Bitbucket's private respository since the project is not meant to be public.
